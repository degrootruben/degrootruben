### Hi there, my name is Ruben! 🏁

- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects but would really like to help on some open source projects!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Python, web development, React.
- 🤔 I'm interested in back end engineering, low level programming languages.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on most back end stuff! However a project in Dutch would also be a lot of fun!
